This Python GUI allows users to select files with specific extensions (.txt, .csv, .pdf) using checkboxes. The user can select or deselect each extension, and the GUI will display the selected files in a list.

The get_selected_files() function in the code returns a dictionary containing the selected file extensions and their associated names. The function also handles errors that might occur if the user deselects an extension that was previously selected.

The code is built using Python's tkinter library, which provides a simple way to create graphical user interfaces. The GUI consists of three checkboxes and a listbox that displays the selected files.

The code is well-documented and can be easily modified to add support for other file extensions or to change the appearance of the GUI.
